<!-- This is my first day with the Odin Project.  Today I learned about the Born Again shell on my m1 mac laptop.  I  also have VsCode up and running.  We got exposure to beginner level HTML as well.  As of my first day, my skills are growing with using VsCode and navigating file structures within the BASH terminal on my unix device.   -->
